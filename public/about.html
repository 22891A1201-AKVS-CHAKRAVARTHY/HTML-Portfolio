  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm AKVS Chakravarthy, and I appreciate you taking the time to learn a bit about me. As a B.Tech undergraduate, I'm actively engaged in exploring the realms of web development, cybersecurity, and machine learning. My passion lies in acquiring new technical knowledge. I often find solace in solitude, which allows me to reflect and work independently, although I do enjoy the company of others. In my leisure time, I'm an avid anime fan and enjoy immersing myself in the world of video games.</p>
